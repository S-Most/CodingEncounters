        <p>When it comes to configuration files and data serialization, JSON and TOML are two popular formats that
            developers encounter regularly. While JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has been the industry standard for
            years, TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) has gained traction as a more human-friendly alternative.
            Let's explore their differences and when to use each.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What is JSON?</h2>
            <p>
                JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for both humans and machines to read and
                write. Originally derived from JavaScript, it has become language-agnostic and is now the de facto
                standard for APIs, configuration files, and data storage. JSON uses a simple syntax with key-value
                pairs, arrays, and nested objects.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "Code Encounters",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "mongoose": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "keywords": ["web", "blog", "coding"]
}</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What is TOML?</h2>
            <p>
                TOML was created by Tom Preston-Werner (co-founder of GitHub) with the goal of being a minimal
                configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML maps unambiguously to a
                hash table and is designed to be more human-friendly than JSON, especially for configuration files. It's
                used by popular tools like Cargo (Rust's package manager) and various Python projects.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-toml">name = "Code Encounters"
version = "1.0.0"
keywords = ["web", "blog", "coding"]

[dependencies]
express = "^4.18.0"
mongoose = "^7.0.0"

start = "node index.js"
test = "jest"</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Differences</h2>

            <h3>1. Readability and Human-Friendliness</h3>
            <p>
                TOML was specifically designed to be more readable than JSON. It eliminates the need for excessive
                brackets, quotes on keys, and trailing commas. This makes TOML particularly well-suited for
                configuration files that humans need to edit frequently.
            </p>

            <div class="code-comparison">
                <div>
                    <div class="code-block-label">JSON</div>
                    <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "database": {
    "server": "192.168.1.1",
    "ports": [8001, 8002, 8003],
    "connection_max": 5000,
    "enabled": true
  }
}</code></pre>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div class="code-block-label">TOML</div>
                    <pre><code class="language-toml">[database]
server = "192.168.1.1"
ports = [8001, 8002, 8003]
connection_max = 5000
enabled = true</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Comments Support</h3>
            <p>
                One of JSON's biggest limitations is the lack of native comment support. While some parsers allow
                comments as an extension, standard JSON does not support them. TOML, on the other hand, has built-in
                support for comments using the <code>#</code> symbol.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-toml"># This is a comment in TOML
[server]
host = "localhost"  # Inline comments are also supported
port = 3000</code></pre>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> The lack of comments in JSON is intentional. Douglas Crockford, JSON's creator,
                removed comments to prevent people from using them to include parsing directives, which would have
                broken interoperability.
            </div>

            <h3>3. Data Types</h3>
            <p>
                Both formats support common data types, but TOML offers more specific types that can be useful for
                configuration files:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>JSON:</strong> strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, objects</li>
                <li><strong>TOML:</strong> strings, integers, floats, booleans, dates/times, arrays, tables (objects)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code class="language-toml"># TOML has native date/time support
published_date = 2025-11-19T08:17:19+01:00

# TOML distinguishes between integers and floats
max_connections = 100
timeout = 30.5

# TOML supports multi-line strings
description = """
This is a multi-line string.
It preserves line breaks and formatting.
Very useful for long descriptions."""</code></pre>

            <h3>4. Nested Structures</h3>
            <p>
                JSON handles nested structures naturally with its bracket notation. TOML uses table headers and
                dot-notation, which can be more verbose but also more explicit and easier to navigate in large files.
            </p>

            <h2>When to Use JSON</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>APIs and Data Exchange:</strong> JSON is the standard for REST APIs and data transmission
                    between services</li>
                <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> Native JavaScript support makes JSON ideal for web development
                </li>
                <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> Nearly every programming language has robust JSON parsing
                    libraries</li>
                <li><strong>Nested Data Structures:</strong> JSON excels at representing complex, deeply nested data
                </li>
                <li><strong>Machine-to-Machine Communication:</strong> When humans don't need to edit the data directly
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>When to Use TOML</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Configuration Files:</strong> TOML's readability makes it perfect for app configuration</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Edited Files:</strong> When developers or users need to frequently modify settings
                </li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Comments support allows inline documentation of configuration
                    options</li>
                <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> TOML's explicit types (dates, integers vs floats) can prevent
                    configuration errors</li>
                <li><strong>Flat Hierarchies:</strong> TOML works best with moderately nested structures</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Popular projects using TOML include Rust's Cargo, Python's Poetry, and Hugo
                static site generator. If you're building developer tools or applications with user-facing
                configuration, TOML is worth considering.

            <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                JSON parsers are generally faster and more optimized due to JSON's widespread adoption and maturity.
                Most programming languages have highly optimized JSON parsers, often written in C or other low-level
                languages. TOML parsers, while improving, are typically slower and less optimized. However, for
                configuration files that are read once at startup, this performance difference is usually negligible.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Both JSON and TOML have their place in modern development. JSON remains the king of data interchange and
                APIs due to its universal support and performance. TOML shines as a configuration format where
                human-readability and editability are priorities. Many modern projects use both: JSON for data exchange
                and TOML for configuration files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice ultimately depends on your use case. If you're building an API or need to exchange data
                between systems, stick with JSON. If you're creating configuration files that humans will edit, consider
                TOML for its superior readability and comment support.
