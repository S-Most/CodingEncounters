            <h1>Exploring the Power of CSS Variables</h1>

            <!-- <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Abstract CSS art"> -->

            <p>CSS variables, also known as custom properties, are a game-changer for modern web development. They allow
                us to store values in one place and reuse them throughout our stylesheets, making our code more
                maintainable, scalable, and easier to theme. In this post, we'll dive deep into how they work.</p>

            <p>One of the most significant advantages is the ability to change a value in one place and have it cascade
                throughout the entire site. This is perfect for theming, responsive design adjustments, and much more.

            <h2>Syntax and Scoping</h2>
            <p>The syntax is straightforward. You declare a variable using a double hyphen, like `--primary-color:
                #3498db;`, and you use it with the `var()` function, like `color: var(--primary-color);`.</p>
